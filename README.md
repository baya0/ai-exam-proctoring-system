# AI-Based Remote Exam Proctoring System

An intelligent desktop application for remote exam supervision using face recognition, anti-spoofing, and behavioral analysis techniques. Designed with privacy and real-time performance in mind, built using Python and PyQt.

---
## Features
- Face Recognition & Verification
  - Uses FaceNet and Siamese Neural Networks for accurate identity verification.
  - Matches live webcam feed with stored reference image.

- Anti-Spoofing Detection
  - Employs a transfer learning model to detect photo/video spoof attempts.
  - Ensures only real human faces are accepted.

- Behavioral Monitoring
  - Eye and mouth movement detection using OpenCV.
  - Head pose estimation and gaze direction analysis.
  - Alerts on abnormal or suspicious behavior (e.g. looking away, talking, multiple faces).

- Object Detection
  - YOLOv5 model for detecting unauthorized devices (e.g., phones, tablets).
  - Flags when more than one person is detected.

- Audio Analysis
  - Monitors ambient sound to detect possible cheating via speech.

- User Interface
  - Built with PyQt6 for exam-taker and supervisor interfaces.
  - Provides live alerts and logs for invigilators.
